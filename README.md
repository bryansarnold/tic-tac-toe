# Tic-Tac-Toe

Simple classic Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played between two users with a few
modern wrinkles added.

## Approach

Create mockup of one page site including the gameboard, login/logout, user icons
 and functionality of each.

Create wireframes to explain the path of the scenarios as the gameplay goes
along.

Set up the HTML and CSS to initiate the look of the one page gameplay
experience.

Set up login/logout/signin/password change functionality for user play.

Create game logic using JS to represent all elements of the board to individual
cells of each square.

Add JQuery event handlers to set up user functionality to each cell on the
gameboard.

Create and update games via Ajax/JQuery.

Add creativity adding some unique spin to the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## User Stories

User's Role: I want to come to a one page site. Sign up or login and play the
classic Tic-Tac-Toe preferably game against an opponent from another device.

User’s Goal - I want to login quickly or maybe just be able to play without
loggin in. Click on the gameboard and display my X or O. Display if I’m the
winner if I match three X’s or O’s in a row. Calculate my score of how many
wins I’ve achieved.

User’s Motivation - Experience a quick classic game that is simple and easy to
use. Provide fun entertainment on the desktop or on the go with mobile.

Admin's Role - I want to create a one page site that can be played online
between two users. They can sign up or login and play the classic Tic-Tac-Toe
game against each other.

## Obstacles

Main issue was time blocking and getting consumed with the game logic. Also,
I should have asked more assistance when met with difficulty from my peers and
instructors. Lastly, taking more care to read documentation would go a long way
to completing the requirements for this project.

## Future Development

Work more on CSS and implementing modals/themes from Bootstrap. Also work on
the modern wrinkles to make the game more challenging such a timer to pace the
player turns and an extra row of cells.
